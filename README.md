* Jump pad - a 2x2' pad to detect jumps from the player and translate them into jumps in-game (Space).
* Movement pad - a 4x4' directional pad to detect a player's steps and press corresponding movement keys (WASD) in-game.
* Aiming joystick - an old joystick retrofitted to move the mouse up and down to allow players to aim in-game.
